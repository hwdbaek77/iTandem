2/6/26: My deliverable before next class is to update the figma with an updated scheduling system structure. I will do this by walking through assumptions and question with Cursor AI.

1.  There is no way for me to get this via the Didax API right now, so if you could write some code to manually parse PDFS to organize them into a data structure.

2. Just compare day 1 with day 1, day 2 with day 2 etc. and then at the end, average out the compatibility percentage amongst all days (for example, if day 1 compatibility is 48% and day 2 compatibility is 76%, then the average between those days would be 62%. Do this for all 6 days.)

3. For odd days, Block 1 is 8:00-9:15, Community Time is 9:15-10:30, Bl

4. No, because some people play sports, so they would be at school until 5pm or even 6pm some days. others end school at 1:30 or even as early as 11:45.

5. Yes, some students will start school at 10:00, 10:30, 12:45 etc.

6. This is only applicable to seniors, only seniors can go off campus for lunch.

7.the co-curricular block is not always the same

I will answer the other assumptions later.
