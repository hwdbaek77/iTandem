- Just to clarify UI when renting your own parking spot: perhaps in the rental screen, there is a button at the top to "Rent Your Spot," which then allows you to select days on a calendar when you will not be using your parking spot.
- Of course, at the beginning of every school year, the app will need to ask you what your parking spot is, preferably with some form of verification. Perhaps it can interact with the HW website or server where that data is stored? Or scan a parking sticker?
- About parking stickers: we would need to interact with security to create some kind of new parking sticker system. The way things currently are right now, you may not be allowed to rent someone's space without the correct parking sticker. You mentioned QR codes that confirm the booking. These could be printed and attached to the windshield as confirmation.
