1. Payment Disputes
What if someone rents a spot but finds it blocked? Or when you have to issue refunds if someone backs out as a renter?
2. Tandem No-Shows
If someone is sick, late, or no shows for a tandem spot, what should the other person do? Is there any protocol for that?
3. Who verifies the rankings for shade, etc for each spot? How is it reputable?
