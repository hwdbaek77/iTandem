I like the overall design

I think that you should make a mockup of each page or at least draw a flowchart diagram.

To me:
- home page with news, suggestions
- Can navigate to a few features from a bottom bar like in your generated images
- rent out or buy parking spots,
- find carpools
- etc


Are you familiar with XCode? Because you're going to need to be in order to code this stuff
I suggest you download XCode right now and honestly just use Cursor to start making the base of the website so that peopole can add on

Also add .DS_Store to your gitignore
