Is Data Driven Spot Intelligence Necessary? I feel like all parking spots are pretty much the same. If there should be any notes on a parking spot, they should be like “no parking spot on the left/right” of this. 
Students should have to sign in using their HW accounts to make sure not some non-HW person tries to use the app and scam students.
What does the home screen look like? I think the home screen should like something that shows three sections: Rent Parking Spot, Find a Tandem Partner, List parking spot 
There should also be a way for students to communicate within the app just in case anything happens – ie. can’t pick up your tandem partner because your sick. 
There should be a deadline for when you can list your parking spot. (ex: Day of @ 6:30am) 
There also needs to be a deadline for when the person who is listing their spot selects their renter. Can’t decide at like 7:55am who they chose to rent their spot.
