1. different profiles for people-- after matching based on location, it would be nice to have profile stats 
	- how long they've been driving
	- types of music listening to, 
	- whether they want to switch off driving or no
	- accident stats (& driver reviews? can submit pictures if they park bad)
	- and back to what was said in the video, what EC restrictions you have

2. an issue for me w/my carpool is that I can't take them home certain days of the week because of my EC. It may be nice to give like a section to connect w/temporary carpools, like if they stay late and need a ride on those days, or if their carpool is sick -- connecting & messaging potential carpools to see if they could give you a lift (for a price probably) -- OH OR IF UR CARPOOL HAS AN X FIRST

3. For monetary coordination for how to split the price, (especially if only one person in ur carpool drives) it would be awesome to add an algorithm that so that you could see how much gas money ur spending based on the commute so you can split the price better. this could also help if you need a temporary ride, where you can calculate a fair price to ask them to drop you off.

4. Why not extend it to the bus? Like if you needa buy a bus pass online

5. give priority of spots to seniors driving with carpools (I'm so mad that I literally have a carpool & I'm stuck in hamilton lot while ppl with no carpool are right in the main lot)

6. Spot rankings based on how badly other ppl around you park LMAO. is price based off of that?? or you can have some fun and make it a bidding system where u set a price & literally like a business haha

7. I would say it would be interesting to see WHEN people use their spot based on when they get to school, but that would be difficult in terms of knowing when they're dropped off by parents or if they're parked. I have this thing w/my carpool that I use shortcuts to send messages when I get into the car (connect to car bluetooth) or when I leave my house at a certain time, it sends a message to them saying  "I'm leaving" or "I'm here". you might be able to work smthn out w/connecting to car bluetooth, location & calendar date to get instant info on what spots are open (excluding ppl who have first off) to just put on the market. NO communication even needed dude wait that would be goated

8. If you expand this to the school, u can literally make it so that all of spot organization is on this app which would be awesome. if it goes well, damn like extend it to other schools thats awesome.

so excited for this -CJ
